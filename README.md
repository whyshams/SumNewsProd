Sumnews is an innovative AI-based news aggregator project focused on Bangladesh. It gathers news from the country's most trusted sources, providing users with a comprehensive overview. With the help of TLDR AI, users can effortlessly summarize these news articles into concise paragraphs, ensuring they receive all the essential information in a single click. Additionally, Sumnews offers a seamless browsing experience by allowing users to access renowned Bangladeshi newspapers' websites directly from the Sumnewsbd.com platform, eliminating the need to navigate elsewhere.

Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA), Sumnews can be installed and utilized as a mobile application, enabling users to stay up to date with the latest news on the go. The project utilizes technologies such as React JS and Next JS for efficient front-end development. It also leverages Google and Bing News APIs for news aggregation, TLDR AI for summarization, and Sanity IO as the content management system (CMS) for seamless content management.
